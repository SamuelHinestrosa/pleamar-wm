//! A computer-use agent's hands: `cua-inject v1`, the line protocol Cua
//! Driver speaks to a compositor of its own (its nested `cua-compositor`),
//! here spoken by the session's. Cua Driver uses it whenever
//! `CUA_INJECT_SOCKET` is set, so the programs this session starts find it.
//!
//! What stock Wayland forbids a program —typing into a window without the
//! keyboard, clicking one that is under another— the compositor can do: the
//! agent has a seat of its own (`cua-agent`, one per cursor), so its pointer
//! and its keyboard are not yours, and your mouse and your focus stay where
//! they are while it works. A program that only listens to one seat
//! (Chromium, GLFW's) gets the agent's events on the usual one instead,
//! straight to its own objects, without moving anybody's focus.
//!
//! Where each cursor is goes to the scene (`agent.$k.x`…), which draws it:
//! a second cursor, moving on its own.
//!
//! The protocol: the client sends `cua-inject v1`, which is echoed back; then
//! one command a line, each answered by `ok` or `err <reason>` once it has
//! been delivered:
//!
//! | command | |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `q PID` | `state FOCUSED_PID foreground|background_visible|background_occluded|not_found` |
//! | `g PID` | `geometry AX AY SX SY`: where the window (AX, AY) and its root surface (SX, SY) are on the desktop |
//! | `x` | the agent has finished: the monitor's light goes out now, not when it would have stopped waiting for its next step |
//! | `l` | `windows` and, per window, `PID X Y W H VISIBLE FOCUSED APP TITLE` (app and title hex encoded), windows separated by `|`: what `pleamar-wm agent windows` shows |
//! | `r PID` | `rect X Y W H VISIBLE`: the root surface's box on the desktop, as the scene shows it, and whether it is seen (1) — what a screenshot of the window is cut from, and what `m`'s coordinates count in |
//! | `f PID` | the keyboard to that process' only window (and its workspace shown) |
//! | `m TARGET IDX X Y` | cursor IDX to X, Y of the window (its root surface's coordinates) |
//! | `b TARGET IDX BUTTON PRESSED` | an evdev button (272 left), 1 down, 0 up |
//! | `a TARGET IDX AXIS VALUE` | the wheel: axis 0 vertical, 1 horizontal |
//! | `t TARGET HEX` | ASCII text, hex encoded, typed into the window |
//! | `k TARGET KEY` | a named key: enter, tab, escape, backspace, space, arrows, f1–f12 |
//! | `h TARGET MODS KEY` | a chord: `ctrl,shift` and a key |
//! | `d X Y COUNT BUTTON` | a click at a point of the desktop |
//! | `R MONITOR HEX` · `R off` | `pleamar-wm remote`: someone uses this desktop from elsewhere, looking at that monitor, from that address (hex encoded) — said again every few seconds while it lasts, and forgotten 15 s after the last |
//!
//! A TARGET is `pid:N` (that process' only window), `root:N` (the only window
//! of that process or a child of it: a browser's), or an app_id.
