# AI policy

pleamar is built with the help of AI, and it's meant to be used with AI: the
installer teaches your agent the language, so you can ask it for a bar. So,
contributions made with AI are welcome, in code, docs and scenes alike.
What matters is not *who* typed it, but that it's good, and that a person
stands behind it.

This applies to the three projects: [pleamar](https://github.com/k4ditano/pleamar),
[pleamar-wm](https://github.com/k4ditano/pleamar-wm) and
[Marea](https://github.com/k4ditano/marea-plm).

## If AI helped with your contribution

- **Say so.** One line in the pull request is enough, e.g. "Written with
  Claude Code, reviewed and tested by me". No need to detail prompts.
- **You're responsible for it.** You've read every line, you understand what
  it does and why, and you can answer questions about it in the review. "The
  AI wrote it" is not an answer to a bug.
- **Test it.** The tests pass (`./run-tests.sh` in pleamar, `cargo test` in
  pleamar-wm), `pleamar --check` is happy with any scene you touched, and for
  anything visual you've seen it running: a screenshot or a short clip in the
  PR helps a lot. The headless mode (`pleamar-wm headless`) lets you do it
  without taking over your screen.
- **Keep it focused.** One change per pull request. A large generated PR that
  touches everything is hard to review and will likely be asked to be split.
- **Follow the house style.** Code, comments and commits in English; comments
  that say *why*, the way the surrounding code does. AI tends to add noise
  (restating the code, generic comments): please trim it.
- **Don't invent.** Language words, services and APIs must exist:
  `pleamar --grammar` lists them. Made-up features in docs or examples will be
  rejected.

## Issues and discussions

Using AI to write a bug report or translate your message is fine. Please make
sure the steps to reproduce are real and that you've actually seen the
problem.

## Licensing

By contributing you confirm you have the right to submit the work under the
project's BSD 3-Clause license, whatever tools you used to write it. Don't
paste code from sources with incompatible licenses, AI-suggested or not.

## The maintainer

Much of pleamar, pleamar-wm and Marea has been written with AI assistance
(Claude), designed, reviewed, tested and used every day by its maintainer.
Known bugs and limitations are documented in pleamar's
`docs/08-limitations.md`, each with its plan.
